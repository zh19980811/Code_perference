# Llama Cookbook: The Official Guide to building with Llama Models

Checkout our latest model tutorial here: [Build with Llama 4 Scout](./getting-started/build_with_llama_4.ipynb)

Welcome to the official repository for helping you get started with [inference](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/getting-started/inference/), [fine-tuning](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/getting-started/finetuning) and [end-to-end use-cases](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/end-to-end-use-cases) of building with the Llama Model family.

This repository covers the most popular community approaches, use-cases and the latest recipes for Llama Text and Vision models.

## FAQ:
## FAQ:

- **Q:** What happened to llama-recipes?
  **A:** We recently renamed llama-recipes to llama-cookbook.

- **Q:** Prompt Template changes for Multi-Modality?
  **A:** Llama 3.2 follows the same prompt template as Llama 3.1, with a new special token `<|image|>` representing the input image for the multimodal models. More details on the prompt templates for image reasoning, tool-calling, and code interpreter can be found [on the documentation website](https://www.llama.com/docs/overview).

- **Q:** I have some questions for Fine-Tuning, is there a section to address these?
  **A:** Checkout the Fine-Tuning FAQ [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/src/docs/).

- **Q:** Some links are broken/folders are missing:
  **A:** We recently did a refactor of the repo, [archive-main](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/archive-main) is a snapshot branch from before the refactor.

- **Q:** Where can we find details about the latest models?
  **A:** Official [Llama models website](https://www.llama.com).
