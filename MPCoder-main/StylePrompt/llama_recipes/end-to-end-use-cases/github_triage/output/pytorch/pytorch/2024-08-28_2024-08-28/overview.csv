These issues are affecting different aspects of the project, such as tensor parallelism, autograd, and CUDA support. To address these challenges, the team needs to prioritize and tackle the root causes, which include missing optimized ops, incompatible backend combinations, and insufficient testing coverage.",17,7,2,21,4,1,21,5,3,3,3,3,5,1,1,2,1,14
