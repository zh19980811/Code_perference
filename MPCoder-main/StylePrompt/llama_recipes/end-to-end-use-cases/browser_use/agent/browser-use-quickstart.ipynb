    "# üåê Building an Intelligent Browser Agent with Llama 3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to creating an AI-powered browser agent capable of navigating and interacting with websites autonomously. By combining the power of Llama 3.2 Vision, Playwright, and Together AI, this agent can perform tasks seamlessly while understanding both visual and textual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Demo\n",
    "For a detailed explanation of the code and a demo video, visit our blog post: [**Blog Post and Demo Video**](https://miguelg719.github.io/browser-use-blog/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Features\n",
    "- Visual understanding of web pages through screenshots\n",
    "- Autonomous navigation and interaction\n",
    "- Natural language instructions for web tasks\n",
    "- Persistent browser session management\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can ask the agent to:\n",
    "- Search for a product on Amazon\n",
    "- Find the cheapest flight to Tokyo\n",
    "- Buy tickets for the next Warriors game\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What's in this Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe walks you through:\n",
    "- Setting up the environment and installing dependencies.\n",
    "- Automating browser interactions using Playwright.\n",
    "- Defining a structured prompt for the LLM to understand the task and execute the next action.\n",
    "- Leveraging Llama 3.2 Vision for content comprehension.\n",
    "- Creating a persistent and intelligent browser agent for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Please note that the agent is not perfect and may not always behave as expected.**\n",
