sophisticated problem-solving capabilities, the core significance of these large language models (LLMs) lies in their emergent abilities, enabling them to tackle a diverse array of tasks with remarkable proficiency.
their remarkable capabilities, have some notable limitations, particularly when considering the advantages offered by open-source models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini. These models are often expensive, with substantial usage fees and restricted access, making them inaccessible to individuals and smaller organizations.
ng restrictions and costs. In contrast, open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Mistral bring several advantages. Accessibility and adaptability are key benefits, as they are more readily available to a broader range of users, including researchers and organizations.
ts. One of the most significant limitations is the smaller model scale, resulting in lower performance on real-world tasks with multiple instructions (Zheng et al., 2023a). Models with fewer parameters struggle to capture the depth and breadth of knowledge embodied in larger models like GPT-4. Additionally, the pre-training investment in these open-source models is typically less substantial. This reduced investment can lead to a narrower range of pre-training data, potentially limiting their understanding and handling of diverse or specialized topics (Liang et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024a). Fine-tuning steps are often fewer due to resource constraints, hindering model optimization for specific tasks or industries.
ary models becomes apparent when compared to highly fine-tuned proprietary LLMs. Primarily, the disparity between proprietary and open-source LLMs becomes evident, with proprietary models excelling in complex scenarios, while open-source models excel in a wide range of scenarios. Knowledge distillation, a technique that leverages the advanced capabilities of proprietary models, is used to enhance the competencies of open-source models. This process is similar to transferring the performance of a skilled teacher to a student.

ned in the era of LLMs, the benefits of knowledge distillation in the era of LLMs are multifaceted and transformative. Through a suite of distillation techniques, the gap between proprietary and open-source models narrows and is filled.

ch domains. The escalating need for a comprehensive survey on the knowledge distillation of LLMs stems from the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and the increasing complexity of these models. The ability to efficiently and effectively distill knowledge from proprietary LLMs to open-source ones becomes a practical necessity. This is driven by the need to bridge the knowledge gap between the proprietary and open-source LLMs.

This need is driven by the 3 models mentioned, including Student, Vicuna, Opt, GPT, and others. These models are being used in various sectors such as law, healthcare, finance, and science, and the ability to distill knowledge from them is becoming increasingly important.

es emerging, but there is still much to be learned from the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this section, we provide a foundational overview of knowledge distillation, highlighting the role of data augmentation (DA) in this context.

Traditional techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning, have shown promise in distilling knowledge from LLMs. However, the increasing complexity of these models requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resources. To further explore the possibilities of knowledge distillation, we examine methods involving supervised fine-tuning, such as incremental learning and transfer learning.

Supervised fine-tuning involves training a model on a smaller dataset with the goal of adapting to a specific task or domain. This approach has shown significant improvement in various NLP tasks, but may not be scalable to large-scale applications. In contrast, transfer learning offers a more flexible approach, where a model is trained on a smaller dataset and then fine-tuned on a larger dataset. This can lead to improved performance on a variety of tasks, but requires careful selection of the target dataset.

Another approach is divergence and similarity, which involve exploring the differences and similarities between the knowledge distillation process and traditional machine learning. Reinforcement learning and ranking optimization are also gaining attention, particularly in the context of knowledge distillation, where the goal is to optimize the distillation process itself. These methods can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge distillation, but require careful consideration of the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.

Skill distillation focuses on enhancing student models to improve their understanding of the task and their ability to perform well on NLP tasks. This can be achieved through various methods, including data augmentation, feature learning, and attention mechanisms. By incorporating these techniques, student models can better understand the context and intentions of the user, leading to improved performance across a variety of tasks.

We propose several strategies for skill distillation, including:

The distillation of knowledge from larger models to smaller ones is a technique used to improve the performance of AI models. In this context, distillation refers to the process of distilling the knowledge from a larger model into a smaller model, allowing it to learn from the teacher model's output.

The current era of knowledge distillation in large language models (LLMs) has shifted the focus from mere architecture compression to a more nuanced process of knowledge elicitation and transfer. This paradigm change is largely due to the immense knowledge that LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini possess. The parameters of LLMs make it challenging to compress them using pruning or quantization techniques.
size, the current focus in llm-based knowledge distillation is to extract and transfer the rich, nuanced understanding that these models have developed the key to this modern approach lies in carefully designed prompts that elicit specific knowledge or capabilities from the llms, tapping into their understanding and capabilities in various domains ranging from natural language understanding to more complex cognitive tasks like reasoning and problem-solving
explicit training objectives. This era of knowledge distillation also emphasizes the transfer of abstract qualities such as reasoning patterns and preference alignment. This is in stark contrast to the earlier focus on output replication, indicating a shift towards a more holistic and comprehensive transfer of cognitive capabilities. The current techniques involve not just the replication of outputs, but also the emulation of thought processes and decision-making patterns of the teacher model. This involves complex strategies like chain-of-thought prompting, where the student model learns the reasoning process of the teacher, enhancing its problem-solving and decision-making capabilities. 2.2 Relation to Data Augmentation (DA)
llation, Unlike traditional techniques such as paraphrasing, or back-translation, which primarily aim at expanding the training dataset in a somewhat mechanical manner. DA within the context of LLMs focuses on the generation of novel, context-rich training data tailored to specific domains and skills. This innovation is driven by the unique capabilities of LLMs to generate coherent, diverse, and intricate data samples that closely mimic the nuanced understanding and cognitive abilities of human experts in various fields.
ource models, through Deep Learning Models (LLMs) are prompted to create targeted, high-quality datasets that are not merely larger in volume but also rich in diversity and specificity. This approach enables the distillation process to be more effective, ensuring that the distilled models replicate the teacher model's output behavior and embody its deep-seated understanding and cognitive strategies. The significance and necessity of Data Augmentation (DA) for achieving Knowledge Domains (KD) in the LLM era cannot be overstated. DA acts as a force multiplier, enabling the distilled models to acquire and refine capabilities that would otherwise require exponentially larger datasets and computational resources. It facilitates a more nuanced and effective transfer of knowledge, focusing on the qualitative aspects of learning rather than quantitative expansion.
er of LLMs empowers open-source models with the ability to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts thereby democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities and fostering innovation across a broader spectrum of applications and users 2 3 Survey Scope Building on the discussions introduced earlier this survey aims to comprehensively explore the landscape of knowledge distillation within the context of LLMs following a meticulously structured taxonomy as in Figure 3 the survey’s scope is delineated through three primary facets each encapsulating a range of subtopics and methodologies
