These methods use various similarity metrics to measure and optimize the congruence of internal representations between the two models. The objective is to ensure that the student model not only produces similar outputs to the teacher but also processes information in a comparable manner. The formulation for a similarity-based objective might look like this: LSim= E x∼X,y∼Y[LF(ΦT(fT(x, y)),ΦS(fS(x, y)))],(11) where fT(x, y)andfS(x, y)are ...\n",
