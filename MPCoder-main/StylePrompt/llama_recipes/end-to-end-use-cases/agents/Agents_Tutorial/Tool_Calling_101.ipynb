    "This tutorial shows you how to apply Tool Calling using Llama models. This tutorial uses Llama 3.3 models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For continuity, we show built-in tool calling that we introduced in Llama-3.1 namely allowing you to use `brave_search` and `wolfram_alpha`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, please remember `3.3` models will work great with zero-shot tool calling which we showcase in second notebook. In fact that is the recommended path.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Setup Groq to access Llama 3.3 70B model\n",
    "- Avoid common mistakes when performing tool-calling with Llama\n",
    "- Understand Prompt templates for Tool Calling\n",
    "- Understand how the tool calls are handled under the hood\n",
