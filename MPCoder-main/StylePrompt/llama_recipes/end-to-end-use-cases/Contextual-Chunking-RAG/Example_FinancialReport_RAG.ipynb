    "# Contextual keywords generation for Financial report document\n",
    "In this Example we will use a Financial report document taken from https://github.com/patronus-ai/financebench/tree/main/pdfs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1) Parse financial report document (pdf file) using LlamaParse.\n",
    "2) Split document into chunks. Here we use basic tokens-based chunking with constant chunk_size, but you can use any other method for chunking.\n",
    "3) Generate contextual keywords for each chunk.\n",
    "4) Create questions related to randomly selected chunks since a predefined test set is unavailable.\n",
    "5) Evaluate the method by retrieving the top five most relevant chunks based on cosine similarity between chunk and question embeddings, checking if the correct chunk is included.\n",
    "6) To compare results with raw content (without keywords), create a new index in the \"Create index\" section and modify the document structure by replacing Document(text='#'+x['keywords']+'\\n'+x['content'], .. ) with Document(text=x['content'], .. ).\n"
